# S.E.A.
A chill audio watercraft simulator originally submitted to [No Video Jam](https://itch.io/jam/no-video-jam).
Developed with [syngen](https://github.com/nicross/syngen).

## Now Available
This game has been remade as part of [Periphery Synthetic EP](https://periphery-synthetic-ep.shiftbacktick.io).

Survey a planetary system in an upgradable exosuit and uncover its mysterious past.
This interactive EP offers a chill and non-violent metroidvania experience across otherworldly musical playgrounds.

## How to Play
You lie prone in your S.E.A., an experimental military watercraft that's fully enclosed.
Moments before, you were dropped off in the middle of the Pacific.
There's no land for days.
It's just you and the sounds of the open sea.
Your mission is to test its capabilities.

The ocean is endless.
Listen and relax.
Surf the waves.
Experiment.
