# ROADMAP
This document outlines upcoming changes for post-jam releases.

## v1.3.0
- Aquatic life (dolphins, gulls, whales, schools of fish)

## Known issues
- Acceleration from zero and turning can be slow on the surface
- Improve collision detection to prevent getting stuck in terrain
- Improve mouse look, perhaps independent from craft physics
- Occasional frame drops on surface
- Treasure causes unstable BiquadFilterNode (possibly fixed)

## Wishlist
### Audio
- Compass cue volume slider
- Dynamic range presets
- Haptic feedback on certain cues

### Graphics
- Procedural skybox with sun, moon, and stars

### Music
- Add more triads to underwater soundtrack
- Add oscillator types/colors with a moving 4D noise field

### Plot
- Abandoned alien labs
  - Spawned more frequently at lower depths
  - Octahedrons generated in deep caves
  - Scanned points are computer sounds
  - High frequency of treasure
  - Unique loot table, specific alien technologies, terraforming devices and rare weapons
- Collectible data logs, letters and reports
  - New Logs screen
  - Logs represent key moments in the lore through creative writing pieces
  - Nonlinear: unlocked chronologically and chosen randomly from a weighted pool
  - Resets progress with each new game
- Crashed alien spaceships
  - Spawned more frequently at higher depths
  - Ovoid or disc, different classes, up to kilometers in scale
  - Carve out tunnels from center to ocean floor
  - Entrance on underside (not guaranteed to be accessible)
  - Perfectly geometric corridors inside
  - Unique loot table, specific alien artifacts
- New game sound (jet flying away)
  - Procedural jets over time

### Quality of Life
- Cave entrance cues (breadcrumbs spawned when reverb change detected)

### Simulation
- Add depth-based probabilities and ranges to treasures (e.g. human junk versus dinosaur bones)
- Advance time when using fast travel
- Light levels influenced by cloud cover, depth, and time of day
- Surface weather patterns
  - Clouds
  - Weather patterns (rain, storm)
- Time of day
  - Moon phases
  - Sun
  - Tides

### World generation
- Biomes
  - Scanned points can be different props determined by noise fields
  - Represented graphically with a range of saturation levels (i.e. albedo)
  - Different musical colors, patterns (aleotoric, step melody), or behaviors entirely

### Miscellaneous
- Photograph mode, or pseudo-bookmarks
