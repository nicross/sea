# ROADMAP
- Exploration props
  - Add props to system that triggers their sounds in a tempo sequence (e.g. every 15 frames) similar to glitter
  - Select frequencies from soundtrack module
- Treasure prop
  - Better cue
- Treasure collection
  - Reward cue
- Gallery screen
  - Improve visual presentation
- Soundtrack
  - Fade in from light zone
  - Long-running low drones
    - pick between four chords
    - three oscillators with slight slow AM positioned binaurally along an equilateral triangle with radius 1
    - respond to position.angle so panning relates to cardinal directions
    - smoothly lerp frequencies over time
  - "Four-dimensional"
    - Chord - X/Y, time is Z axis, X/Y are also offset over time at constant rate
    - Color - X/Z, time is Y axis, X/Z are also offset over time at constant rate
    - Inversion - Y/Z, time is X axis, Y/Z are also offset over time at constant rate
    - need to know previous and next values for lerping
  - List of partials (integer harmonic series) for exploration node to pick from
- Cue when switching between turbo states (like soundStrider auto-move toggle)
- Mouse controls (left/right look, sensitivity slider, click to move, hook turning into engine sounds)
