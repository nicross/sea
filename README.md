The ocean is endless.
Listen and relax.
Surf the waves.
Experiment.

  <summary>Heavy Spoiler Warning</summary>

  <summary>Ultimate Spoiler Warning</summary>
  <p>S.E.A. is an underwater cave diving simulator with mild dungeon crawling elements. It's influenced by games like Sub Culture and Scanner Sombre. At its surface it presents a false exterior of being a relaxing watercraft simulator. Deep below lies a vast oceanic landscape filled with procedurally generated caves. With its scanning mechanic players paint a sonic trail of the areas they've visited with the chance of revealing valuable treasures to collect for their personal galleries. What will you find beneath the surface?</p>
  <p>Please be mindful of these spoilers while discussing this game.</p>
