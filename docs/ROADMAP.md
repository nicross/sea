# ROADMAP
- Polish
  - Simplify movement collision detection as cube that never turns so players are less likely to get stuck
  - Cues when passing compass rose points while turning
  - Mouse controls (left/right look, sensitivity slider, click to move, hook turning into engine sounds)
  - Look into any other directional cues treasure can provide
  - Add seeded offsets to terrain fields so they're more random
  - Revisit mix
