# S.E.A.
An atmospheric audio watercraft simulator submitted to [No Video Jam](https://itch.io/jam/no-video-jam).

## How to Play
You lie prone in your S.E.A., an experimental military watercraft that's fully enclosed.
Moments before, you were dropped off in the middle of the Pacific.
There's no land for days.
It's just you and the sounds of the open sea.
Your mission is to test its capabilities.

The ocean is endless.
Listen and relax.
Surf the waves.
Experiment.
